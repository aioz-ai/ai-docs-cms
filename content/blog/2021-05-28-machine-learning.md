In the golden edge of technology, Machine Learning is one of the leading wave majors. Humans learn by their past experience and so do machines. They learn from data to imitate us. However, it's not easy to run a Machine Learning project; you have to be strong enough to face challenges.

But what is Machine Learning and why it's become one of the most popular careers nowadays?

Let's find out this!

### What is Machine Learning?

According to the definition of Wikipedia, "Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so‚Äù.

Too abstract! You still too vague? Let's take a look at ML products in our real life.

Facebook, which looks pretty familiar to you, right? It also has developed a machine-learning algorithm to create new features, make it more and more user-friendly. I have read an article that a man got back his belongings after two days got lost. A woman picked up his wallet and shared it on Facebook; thanks to Facebook facial recognition, it has verified the photo from his ID card and sent a notification to him. This feature was built to recognize a person if his or her photo is used by someone else by using a machine-learning algorithm to analyze images.

Not only Facebook but other products or applications also have facial recognition functions, such as Apple products, e-wallet, banking applications, etc. Machine Learning is the symbol of digital edge. However, obstacles always have no matter what you do.

### Data: the most significant problem

It is undeniable that data is the most important. Machine learn from data, so this is an indispensable part. Data is the core of machine learning, it takes a large amount of data for computers to "learn". The more data, the faster the accuracy and processing speed of the model. We can't do machine learning algorithms if we don't have enough data, it's a key to open the machine learning door. However, finding and collecting data is not easy, especially for startups like AIOZ. Moreover, the data can also be related to customer security issues, so sometimes, they will not be willing to provide it.

Besides, many customers still do not truly understand the importance of data, do not understand the meaning of data with corresponding functions, and have features that require diversity in data to be implemented. Having enough data but discrepancies in data can also make it difficult for engineers to program. The input of the data can be from many different types of cameras, different viewing angles, different quality, effects from camera input, images, videos are essential: weather, dust, light, darkness, dazzling, etc.

Lack of data is also the biggest obstacle for people working in Machine Learning in general and ML engineers of AIOZ in particular. However, thanks to its advanced machinery system and superior hardware power, AIOZ's engineers can partly overcome the data difficulties, ensuring the model is fast enough and the model size is small enough.

To get quality data for training, ML engineers have to build algorithms to process data and filter input. If the data is small, use an algorithm to create diversity in the data. In addition, it is also necessary to collect and process additional data from multiple sources.

ML engineer is one of the best jobs nowadays. With the advancement of society, our engineers are constantly striving to meet the increasing demands in technology.

No matter what industry you are in, there are times when you face obstacles and challenges, but the important thing is that you know how to overcome them. With a passion for technology, especially AI, the AIOZ team with a strong foundation in Machine Learning, we're willing to take on new challenges to build up advanced technology.
