### Hello! My name is Beetle Bot!

The robot industry is still quite new to us, but with the development of technology, in the future robots will not be too strange for us anymore. Welcome to AIOZ where Beetle Bot was born. The Beetle Bot is an indoor delivery robot that uses artificial intelligence and voice interface technology. With a compact design, taking the main white font, user-friendly.

Integrated with unique technologies, we can easily connect with Gen Z through QR code, Gen Z has a radar system that can dodge obstacles, rotate 360 degrees. With the map you build on your mobile, the robot can automatically find the way. We also can adjust the map every time. Besides, with a Q&A feature implemented on the robot, you can communicate with the robot at the basic level.

Qualcomm Vietnam Innovation Challenge has created a healthy playground for young technology startups in Vietnam to unleash their creativity. Although the contest has ended, this long journey still leaves a strong impression on each member of AIOZ.

Let's look back on the journey of more than a year participating in the competition of AIOZ. From Fed to Sep 2020, we applied our solution proposal to the QVIC program. Then, in October 2020, we were recognized as one of the top 10 companies during the shortlist pitching. In Sep 2021, we completed the QVIC finale round and passed through 2 sessions of engineering pitching & business pitching. And finally, after all the best effort, we win to break the competition as the 2nd rank of the winners.

Participating in the Qualcomm Vietnam Innovation Challenge, we have learned a lot of experience, as well as exchanged more practical knowledge. AIOZ will use the prize and the experience gained from the competition to update the Beetle Bot - Gen Z product, bring it closer to everyone so that people know more about robots.
