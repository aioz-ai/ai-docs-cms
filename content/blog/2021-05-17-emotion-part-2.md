We have developed many applications around emotion recognition technology. Among those, the main application is to record the audience's reaction to a movie.

Nowadays, entertaining by watching movies has become more and more popular. As the film industry grows, there are more and more diverse genres of movies for audiences to choose.
In addition to the audience's hesitation in choosing a movie, theaters also have a headache in choosing the right movie for their customers' tastes. There are many films produced, but not all films can be published, and not all of those published films can bring in high revenue.
Besides good marketing that will affect customers' choices, the quality of a movie also has a significant influence. To know if a movie attracts viewers or not, we need to collect data on their emotions when enjoying the movie.

For example, most everyone in the cinema concentratedly watching the movie The Avenger: End Game. Not only that, but they also looked very excited and had a lively discussion after the movie ended. With these data, they will likely return to enjoy another Marvel movie.

**Why do we choose this?**

Watching movies is no longer a luxury need. It has become widespread for young people to go to the cinemas these days. Especially in the summer, when a lot of great movies are coming out. Besides, young people's motivation to go to the cinema now is dating, friendship, etc. For adults, watching movies for entertainment after work has also gradually become popular.

As the needs increase, the supply increases. We believe that the movie market is very potential, and it is worth trying an AI solution to take this market a step further. Moreover, data collecting in the cinemas is also accessible because they are always fixed in their seats.

About 30 years ago, people went to cinemas to watch movies. These days, audiences have the opportunity to enjoy other additional services such as dining, shopping before and after viewing because most of today's large-scale, modern cinemas are located close to supermarkets or shopping malls. Modern cinemas integrate smart Ads screens. This integration will bring huge benefits, not only advertising movies but also advertising other services and products.

These days, audiences have the opportunity to enjoy other additional services such as dining, shopping before and after viewing.

It's not all about watching a movie and leave, people most likely will go shopping, and their emotions will significantly influence their behavior. By analyzing customer emotions, we can advertise a series of suitable products to them after leaving the cinema.

For example, young people have just finished watching the End Game, and they seem to be enjoying it! We'll promote a few movie-related merchandise such as Iron man t-shirts, superhero figures, or trailers for other Marvel movies.

We can even recommend some shows at home to the audiences through the data that has been analyzed at the theater. The way these idea works is similar to suggesting videos on the same topic as videos a user has interacted before on Youtube, Tiktok or Twitter. All data is shared, creating a vast information system.

The end of part 02.
