### Let's make your avatar alive

Have you ever heard about Metaverse yet? In the near future, we will have a virtual world where you can interact with your friends, your colleague, your family in the "real" way no matter where you are. Are you waiting for it? 

With the ambition to turn the concept of "Metaverse" only in books into real life. Tech giant Facebook has changed its name to Meta, leveraged AI to build apps that we can create a digital moving avatar by using just a single photo of a person. Metaverse uses artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze the input sound and create a mouth shape for a portrait photo that makes you feel like the photo is talking. The future will be even better when you can create your own 3D version of your living avatar with just a few simple steps, AI algorithms have been developed to create photorealistic avatars that give you realistic and immersive experiences.

With the combination of virtual reality (VR) technology, augmented reality (AR) these virtual avatars are embedded in VR headsets allowing users to build their own characters. Metaverse promises to remove all barriers of geographical distance and be considered as the next chapter of the Internet.

### From living avatar to everything

Living avatar is the beginning of a new Internet era. Not only Facebook, but Metaverse is also currently a new technology trend implemented by many companies such as Microsoft, Tencent, Nvidia, etc. 

It can be said that VR technology is the bridge, AI is the guide. Meetings will become more interesting when you join a virtual meeting room where you can communicate directly with colleagues through the witty characters your colleagues choose. Group chats will no longer be tasteless with only boring messages. Meeting friends in the virtual world will bring you new experiences when you can move things from the physical world into the virtual world.
