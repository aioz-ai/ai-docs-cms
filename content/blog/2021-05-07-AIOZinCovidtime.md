According to Tuoi Tre Newspaper, up to 87.2% of businesses are negatively affected by COVID-19 in 2020, data released by the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) in coordination with the World Bank (WB) on the morning of March 12th, 2021.

The picture of the economy in the year of Covid is grey, as a start-up company, 2020 for AIOZ is probably the most unforgettable year, a year full of difficulties and challenges.

### How is Covid epidemic affect us?

As the Covid epidemic had a very negative impact on the company's business, since most of the customers were overseas, the closure of international commercial flight routes by countries causes reaching customers to seem more and more difficult. Moreover, customer support and warranty cannot be carried out. Therefore, it is very hard to find investment sources during the epidemic period.

In order to prevent the spread of coronavirus, ensure social distance and maintain operations in difficult times, AIOZ had to let employees work from home. Even though our members work from home, they still guarantee work efficiency, keep in regular contact and support each other when needed.

In addition, we also had to reduce employee's salaries to cut down costs. Despite the salary reduction, AIOZers' working morale has not eased up, besides the tasks that need to be completed, they are still enthusiastic about participating in domestic competitions to challenge themselves and improve the company's value.

### How AIOZers struggle with Covid?

As dynamic young people who are passionate about challenge and creativity, in April 2020, a group of members of AIOZ joined in the virtual hackathon “HACK CO VY 2020” competition launched by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Viet Nam, AngelHack, and the Hanoi Youth Union partner.

The competition took place for only 2 days from April 24 to 26. With 48 short hours, the whole team worked hard day and night, making their best efforts to complete the AI applications of BeetleBot, a product that supports doctors in the anti-epidemic era. BeetleBot successfully convinces the organizers and bringing victory for our company. Helping the company to be known by more people. Not only in Hack Co Vy, BeetleBot also won awards in many other big and small competitions such as: AI-Challenge, Incubation, Qualcomm, etc.

Moreover, the members of AIOZ also participate in the competition to apply algorithms and potential AI solutions using Artificial Intelligence to solve important problems for life. Except for stressful working hours, they also have to make endless efforts to keep up with the competition's progress. The awards achieved during this period greatly encouraged the spirit of the whole company.

Not inferior to the Product team, the members of the Research team also have a certain contribution to the company, although they do not meet each other regularly on the company, the whole team still promotes teamwork. During the work from home period, we researched and successfully published a paper on the subject of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. Bringing the company's name to the world. Besides, the team also researches the topics to support the Product team to build the product.

### AIOZ. Together. We got through it.

The Covid pandemic has made things more difficult than ever, but fortunately, we have teammates who still stand by AIOZ. Thanks to them, the company's business situation started to look good and overcome this turbulent year.

Greatly thank for your effort and your trust!
