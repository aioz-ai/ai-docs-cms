When it comes to the digital world, the first thing that appears to mind is digitization. Perhaps we never thought that science and technology could develop as today. Now is the era of data, everything is gradually being digitized, this is the inevitable process of the 4.0 technology revolution.

### What is digitization?

It is hard to deny the great benefit of digitization, it helps us to save time, space, and costs. Digitalization is impacting every sector. Compared to Gen Z, previous generations are facing many difficulties when everything is gradually digitized like this. Businesses also have to change the way they operate to keep up with the times.

Besides, many companies also apply AI, computer vision, etc. in marketing activities to attract customers, AI solutions can analyze customer behavior and offer a suitable marketing strategy for the customer group. Digitization and digital transformation have greatly helped businesses in the race to the market.

### For technology users

How about those who are not familiar with technology?

Today's technology products are all built to be simple for users to use. However, there are still many people who still face many barriers when using them. Especially people over 50 years old are used to using manual methods, so automation applications seem too strange and difficult to use.

In Vietnam, the government is progressively digitizing administrative procedures for straightforward storage and management by mobilizing people to change to ID cards with chips. In the near future, ID cards may replace many other types of paper, all information is stored in the national information system. Therefore, it can be easily accessed when people come to do administrative procedures, people will not need to spend time with cumbersome procedures like before. In addition, with the citizen's chip-mounted ID card, we can also be flexible in modifying and supplementing information.

The development of digital technology has opened up for us a new era, more modern, faster, more convenient. But besides that, it also requires technology users to get used to them or there are people who have been already used to the old ways and be afraid to change.

My parents are people of the 60s generation, with the explosion of smartphones, they have switched to using smartphones, but still have difficulty in using it, mostly just for calling and answer the phone, not know how to use mobile apps. For example, using a bank's application to transfer money or manage their account, they still need support to get used to because the interface of the current app is still quite complicated for the elderly.
