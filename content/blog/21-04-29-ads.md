# What is Smart Advertising?

Smart Advertising is displayed on flat screen devices. This is the advertising trend of the new era, taking advantage of the advantages of technology to create impressive media campaigns. The advertising screens not only advertise but also increase the aesthetics of the surrounding environment. Up to now, this form has been deployed quickly and strongly in the central locations of the commercial centers in big cities. Smart Advertising can display flexible message images, sharp and eye-catching images are displayed, attracting customers' attention. On the other hand, we can easily change the theme of the ads based on each period of time, thereby increasing brand awareness as well as boosting sales.

For example, a customer may be confused about what to eat today but after seeing an advertisement of KFC: "KFC Lunch promotion, 50% discount". Most likely, this customer will visit KFC for their lunch.

In addition, customers can choose to watch advertising actively without being annoyed. Unlike advertisements on online media, which force users to watch ads that are densely nested on social networking sites, movies, and videos. This kind of advertising is somewhat annoying and can lead to the opposite effect, making customers averse to the advertised items. Therefore, some famous brands focus on smart advertising to reach only potential customers.

Advertising will be played at a time when customers are comfortable to watch them. Every day, there are thousands of people coming in and out of shopping malls for shopping and entertainment. Advertising effects on customers' psychology will motivate them to shop and experience the product.

Smart Advertising is considered a modern advertising type. They are often installed in "prime" locations that viewers are hard to ignore such as elevator lobbies, inside the elevators, parking lots, or corridors.

# Why is ours different?

Most of the smart billboards you see in the Malls nowadays are just screens that replay a list of ads which is already setup beforehand. That means if the playlist is about a KFC advertisement, for the hungry or the full it will still be KFC, for the businessman or the housewife will also be KFC.

We are different because we integrate AI processing, analyze potential customers based on their characteristics, thereby providing reasonable advertising, increasing the likelihood of buying excitement.

Our algorithms analyze customers' age, gender, and costumes (clothing and accessories), from which we can reliably evaluate their preferences and needs and then publish them.

In addition, we also identify the fashion brands. By identifying the brands that customers wearing, we can advertise the brands they love. Thanks to that, this form convinces users to "pay off" and makes consumers carve their brand deeply. With the ability to break through ideas, deeply understand the market as well as the needs of customers, we have contributed to enhancing the brand of Smart Advertising. The advertising products all meet the standards of aesthetics and content in the modern trend. Do you want to boost revenue for your business? Start the AIOZ smart advertising now!
