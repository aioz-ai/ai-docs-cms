If you're a fan of Marvel, you must know Jarvis, a super assistant of Iron Man - our hero. While watching the movie I was impressed with what Tony was able to do with Jarvis with his multiple functions. It was implemented AI techniques like natural language processing, speech recognition, face recognition, and reinforcement learning.

Have you ever wondered whether we can build our own Jarvis? The answer is yes! Tech wizard - Mark Zuckerberg built his own Jarvis AI. He started to create a simple AI to help him in his home by talking with his AI butler via an APP he coded by himself which uses AI to understand him. With a sort of video of fewer than three minutes, we can see some of the tasks that Mark's Jarvis can do like: wake him up every morning, play with his children, etc. One of the best things about Jarvis is his friends' facial recognition at the door. Although it is still not as perfect as the Jarvis in the Iron Man version, with the current development of science and technology, we should believe that will come true in the near future. It's just the beginning!

If you've used AI Assistant before, I'm sure you'll be amazed at what it can do. AI continues to innovate and the world is transforming. So what you waiting for, let's own an AI Assistant.
