With such a dry thing, what makes you love it? If you work in a place where people are passionate about technology. Although sometimes you're under pressure because of the difficult problems, unable to find solutions. But technology has its own appeal, and you will be inspired by it day by day.

When I first started working at AIOZ I was still ambiguous with the meaning of technology, at the beginning, I was completely unfamiliar with something call algorithm, frontend, backend, real-time, API, blockchain, etc. I just admire what the power of technology can do, it saves us time and makes complex things more straightforwardly. But my colleagues didn't treat me like I don't know anything, they help me to deal with it, they willing to do me a favor at any time.

When you are a girl and work in a predominantly male environment, how do you feel? Stuffy, rigid or vibrant, animated? For a company specializing in technology, the number of male employees more than female employees is a very normal thing.

AIOZ builds a product for the community, there are different thoughts between men and women, if just only men join to create the software, you will miss half of customers' requirements. So bringing some flowers to the monotonous office is not a bad idea!

At AIOZ, there are only two female employees working with countless young men, so how to survive a male-dominated technology environment? Sometimes you will feel like you are about to become a real man. Of course, you will also receive the female privilege.

To be a women working in tech

- Donâ€™t be afraid to ask for help
- Take along your idea to work
- Stick together with your colleagues

Although there is a big gap between the number of male and female employees in AIOZ, there's no problem for every part of us to interact with others.

And there's no problem for us to create a practical product for the community, either!
